* Things to do:
** DONE sync menu snakes to menu music
*** initial delay + yoyoing tween of specified step-count
** DONE add music
*** DONE menu
*** DONE intro
*** DONE levels
*** DONE outro
*** DONE credits
** DONE create credits scene
** DONE create outro cutscene
** DONE flipped rat sprite for when (< 90 rotation 270)
*** just check for negative x velocity, close enough
** DONE extend patterns
*** DONE level 1
*** DONE level 2
*** DONE level 3
** DONE create between-level score scene
** DONE get rats moving
*** DONE get them stopping when caught
*** DONE get them to follow paths
**** just tweening their velocity with sigmoidal easing functions.
*** DONE telegraph incoming rats
** DONE create hazard indicator sprites
*** can we just do geometric? might be easier for tweening alpha
** DONE figure out how to grab rats
*** DONE autograbbing on collision
*** DONE update rat animations appropriately
*** DONE respect rat rotation
**** NOT WORTH IT
** DONE create rat sprite
** DONE make orange flipped sprite just alternative animations
** DONE implement better snake movement
